# EMEA Engineer's Onboarding Buddies

<br>

**ðŸ‘‹ Hi Buddy! Congratulations!**

<br>

<div style="text-align: justify"> So, someone nominated you Onboarding Buddy, but what does that mean?

By definition, an Onboarding Buddy is a current employee who serves as a new hireâ€™s informal support system through their onboarding experience. This dynamic creates a flexible relationship, so that new hires may be more comfortable relying on for questions and concerns they are intimidated to ask.

Sound easy right?! 

Don't worry, we've got your back. The following are specific responsabilities and guidelines that you can use to get started on your new role.</div>

<br>

## Responsabilities of an Onboarding Buddy

<br>

1. **Welcome the New-Hire on their first day**

    <div style="text-align: justify"> A New-Hire's first day can be a a stressful and nerve-wracking event, specially if they are external. Make sure you are waiting to greet them as they enter the team. An onboarding buddy can ease the tension, especially while waiting for orientation to begin.</div>

<br>

2. **Introduce the New-Hire to other colleagues and help expand their network.**

    <div style="text-align: justify"> In the first days on the job, you should make a point to introduce the New-Hire to as many co-workers as possible. Direct team members that they will work with on a regular basis.</div>

<br>

3. **Be aware of the onboarding process and help the New Hire verify it.**

    <div style="text-align: justify"> One of the most important responsabilities you'll have as an onboarding buddy is to answer questions about the company, role and proceedments. Feel free to share your own experiences and the learnings you took from them that can help answer questions and ease concerns.</div>

<br>

4. **Elevate the importance of tools, reports and processes (planner, feedback, initiatives, etc.).**

<br>

5. **Help New Hire understand the Orgâ€™s structure (LTX, Regions and Hub).**

<br>

6. **Help New Hire start picking projects and engagements in alignment with their capabilities and interests.**

<br>

7. **Urge New Hire to discuss Orgâ€™s strategy and OKRs with their manager.**

<br>

8. **Schedule weekly calls with New Hire for at least 2 months.**

    <div style="text-align: justify"> Along with all the point mentioned so far, it would be great if you could hold weekly check-in meetings with your New-Hire for at tleast the first weeks of their tenure. This can be as informal as a lunch meeting and the goal is for you to gauge how comfortable the New-Hire is in the company and their new role. You should be sure to answer any lingering questions until the New-Hire feels completely acclimated to the company.</div>

## Tips to be a successful Onboarding Buddy

<br>

<div style="text-align: justify"> Aside from the steps mentioned above, here are a few tips on creating a successful New-Hire/Onboarding Buddy relationship.

<br>

- **Be Patient**. New-Hires are nervous and wonâ€™t understand everything on the first day. Be patient with them and make sure to confirm that the New-Hire is confident in each task they are introduced to.

- **Offer Feedback**. Feedback in the form of constructive criticism and praise can expedite a New-Hireâ€™s productivity. You should offer advice on how to better approach tasks that New-Hires struggle with and provide praise for a job well done.

- **Donâ€™t try to cover everything at once**. Overwhelming a New-Hire with information will only hinder their progress when onboarding. Break the information in parts, leverage the weekly check-ins to introduce new topics and make sure the New-Hire completely understands what theyâ€™re covering before moving on to the next piece of information.

- **Donâ€™t try to force the relationship**. Not all working relationships are perfect from the start. There may be a difference in personality type or learning style between you and your New-Hire. Instead of trying to force the relationship or abandoning it altogether, take time to allow the relationship to form naturally.</div>
