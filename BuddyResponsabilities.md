# EMEA Engineer's Onboarding Buddies

Hi Buddy! Congratulations!

So, someone nominated you Onboarding Buddy, but what does that mean?

By definition, an Onboarding Buddy is a current employee who serves as a new hireâ€™s informal support system through their onboarding experience. This dynamic creates a flexible relationship, so that new hires may be more comfortable relying on for questions and concerns they are intimidated to ask.

Sound easy right?! 

Don't worry, we've got your back. The following are specific responsabilities and guidelines that you can use to get started on your new role. 

## Responsabilities of an Onboarding Buddy

1. Welcome the New-Hire on their first day

A New-Hire's first day can be a a stressful and nerve-wracking event, specially if they are external. Make sure you are waiting to greet them as they enter the team. An onboarding buddy can ease the tension, especially while waiting for orientation to begin.

2. Introduce the New Hire to other colleagues and help expand their network


3. Be aware of the onboarding process and help the New Hire verify it.
